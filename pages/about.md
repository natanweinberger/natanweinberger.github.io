I'm a software engineer in Philadelphia.

This blog is intended to be a collection of guides, with a few motivations in particular.

### Solidifying my understanding of the topic

In most posts, there's one concept that I realize I'm struggling to clearly explain to my future self. It probably means that my grasp isn't as firm as I thought and needs more attention.

### Providing a single resource that will make sense in six months

It usually takes more than a single StackOverflow post or page of documentation to understand a topic. These articles are intended to be a "best-of" collection of the descriptions and examples that made those concepts click for me.

Ideally, this blog will cut down on the time it takes to re-learn a topic and will serve as a great reference.


### Becoming a better communicator

You can only improve with practice, right? I'm hoping that pushing myself to explain what I've learned will make me a better communicator.
