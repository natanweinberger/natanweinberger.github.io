I'm a software engineer in Philadelphia.

This blog is intended to be a collection of guides, with a few motivations in particular:

### It solidifies my understanding of the topic

In most posts, there's at least one concept that I struggle to explain to my future self. I think this is indicative that my grasp isn't as firm as I thought, and needs more attention.

### It provides a single resource that will make sense six months in the future

It usually takes more than a single StackOverflow post or page of documentation to understand a topic. These articles are intended to be a "best-of" collection of the descriptions and examples that made those concepts click for me.

Ideally, it will cut down on the time it takes to re-learn a topic and will serve as a reference.
